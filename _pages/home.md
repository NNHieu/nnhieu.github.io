<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


üëã Hi! I'm Hieu (Pronounce: h…™…ô ä).


I'm currently a Research Assistant at [MAIL Research lab](https://khoadoan.me/) and [SAIL](https://www.sail-research.com/), working with Professors [Khoa D. Doan](https://khoadoan.me/), [Kok-Seng Wong](https://www.sail-research.com/) and [Le Duy Dung](https://andrew-dungle.github.io/).


Previouly, I was an AI resident at [FPT AI Center](https://fpt-aicenter.com/en/ai-residency) under the supervision of [Dr. Hoang Thanh-Tung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xZU08d0AAAAJ&hl=en). 
I completed my B.Sc Honours degree in Computer Science at [VNU-UET](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/en/), advised by [Dr. Hoang Thanh-Tung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xZU08d0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Viet-Cuong Ta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=j9_spcUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 


You can find my academic resum√© [here](assets/pdf/AI_ML_Research_Resume.pdf) (updated in Dec 2024).

##### Primary research interests

I am eager to (i) understand the foundations, strengths, and limitations of data and learning algorithms and (ii) build learning systems better capable of system 2 tasks such as reasoning and planning.
